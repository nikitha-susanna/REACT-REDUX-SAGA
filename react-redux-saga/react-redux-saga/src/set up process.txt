1) created react app using the command npx create-react-app <project-name>

3) created the directories as required 
	
   src
	|--> redux
	|	|--> actions
	|	|--> reducer
	|--> Store.js

4) created the Action.js file to specify the functions to be added
   
   |--> actions
	|		|--> Action.js

5) created ActionTypeConstant.js to store the and export the strings to indicate the type of the action
   
   src

6) created the Reducer.js file to add the reducer functions 

   |--> reducer
	|		|--> Reducer.js

7) created A file called RootReducer.js because store accepts only object
